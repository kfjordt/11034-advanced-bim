### Use case: Construction / Cost
#### Primary instructions
The Python modules `shapely` and `ifcopenshell` are used to parse the IFC model. *Node.js* also needs to be installed. When in the root directory, run 
`npm install express`.

To start the tool, run the Python-script `main.py`. This will parse the IFC model found in the subfolder "model". If more than one model is present in the folder, the first model, ordered alphabetically, will be parsed.

This will export a JSON file `data.json` and mulitple .svg-files (one pr. floor) to the folder "output". When this file is succesfully saved, `node server.js` may be run in the command line, after which the main GUI can be accessed at `http://localhost:3000`.

#### Changes
There is no longer any static HTML and `index.js` only contains the basic structure for the website. The input table is generated by JavaScript at run-time and all SVG-related entities are accessed from the files. Furthermode, *Node.js* and the JavaScript framework *Express* is used to simulate a more realistic web-based development, which would be needed anyways in order to establish a proper Speckle link (see next section).

#### Future work
The IFC data itself is still static. The plan was to establish a connection to a Speckle stream at run-time and have this be the main data source. We ran into some issues when trying to do this (see thread in Speckle forums https://speckle.community/t/reading-speckle-stream-from-javascript/4145), but further conversation with a Speckle employee ensured that this would be doable using Speckle's GraphQL API. Instead of manually drawing the SVG objects, it would also be beneficial to utilize a pre-made library/framework like *IFC.js*, *Three.js* or maybe even *SVG.js*.
