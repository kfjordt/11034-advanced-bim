## Changes
This assignment sought to make a further optimization of assignment 1. An interactive webpage has been made that have same functionalities, but also printing out a plane for a given floor. Instead of running a python script, now the user puts data directly into the webpage and a calculation is made for the building and for each floor, with a floor plan.
