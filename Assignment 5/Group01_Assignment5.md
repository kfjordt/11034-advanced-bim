## Reflections on our work
We chose to build an audit tool for consulting engineers to monitor the impact of the different material choices in the project. This was done with respect to the cost, structural calculations and the carbon emissions of the building. The tool itself needs quite a bit of work for it to be functional - mainly establishing a link to a Speckle stream which would promote good data culture in the project (i.e. everyone having access to the same data/single source of truth) and preserve the version history of all the material data.

We do not ourselves have any plans to continue the work. An application to "actually" solve this use case and be usable in real-life-scenarios would be fairly large scale project. However, it would be interesting to look further into the IFC-based SVG drawings and optimize this process. SVG represents a more data-rich and user-friendly format than PDF while still being able to process virtually the same kind of data (i.e. geometric shapes and text). In the building industry (from a BIM perspective), all the different kinds of PDF features (i.e. hyperlinks, security passwords, signatures) are rarely used. Obviously, for tasks such as document handling and documentation, PDFs have their purpose, but when you boil its main purpose - that being representing a building in 2D - SVG drawings offer an interesting perspective. Imagine an SVG drawing containing 1000 polygons with their own unique IDs coupled with an SQL database (or perhaps even a Speckle stream). This would offer an interesting alternative to Revit for some very specific use cases: It would be much less computationally heavy (i.e. a relatively small amount of raw text compared to a bloated Revit model of 1GB) and open source - everyone can run it regardless of licensing.

If future work were to be conducted for the project as it is now, it would make good sense to port the project to a JS library/framework instead of doing everything in native JavaScript. For instance, React would be a good choice because of the UI heavy nature of a BIM application. For handling the IFC parts of the application, the framework IFC.js would be optimal to use to parse the IFC files, thereby eliminating the need for Python and making the application purely web-based.
